# Enhanced Index Tracking with Distributionally Robust Optimization

This repository will hold the implementations and data sources related to my master thesis in "MSc. in Mathematical Modelling and Computation" at Technical University of Denmark (DTU). 

## Implementation of Classical Index Tracking

In this section, I attempt to reproduce results from the paper "Optimal construction and reblancing of index-tracking portfolios" by O. Strub, P. Baumann.
