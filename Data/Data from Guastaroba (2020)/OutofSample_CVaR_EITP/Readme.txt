These data files are the out-of-sample data used Guastaroba, G., Mansini, R., Ogryczak, W. and Speranza, M.G.. Enhanced Index Tracking with CVaR-Based Measures.

There are currently 12 data files. The format of these data files is:

 T_OoS
 q_10, q_11, q_12, q_13,..., q_1T_OoS
 q_20, q_21, q_22, q_23,..., q_2T_OoS
					...
 q_n0, q_n1, q_n2, q_n3,..., q_nT_OoS
 q_I0, q_I1, q_I2, q_I3,..., q_IT_OoS
 
where: 

 T_OoS is the number of out-of-sample time periods;
 q_jt is the quotation of security j, j=1,...,n, in out-of-sample time period t, t=0,1,...,T_OoS. To the sake of convenience, we also report the quotation of each security under in-sample scenario T. It corresponds to t=0;
 q_It is the quotation of the benchmark index in time period t, t=0,1,...,T_OoS. To the sake of convenience, we also report the quotation of the benchmark index in scenario T. It corresponds to t=0;
