These data files are the in-sample data used in Guastaroba, G., Mansini, R., Ogryczak, W. and Speranza, M.G.. Enhanced Index Tracking with CVaR-Based Measures.

There are currently 12 data files. The format of these data files is:

 n
 T
 p_t
 r_11, r_12, r_13,..., r_1T
 r_21, r_22, r_23,..., r_2T
	    ...
 r_n1, r_n2, r_n3,..., r_nT
 r_I1, r_I2, r_I3,..., r_IT

where: 

 n is the number of securities;
 T is the number of scenarios;
 p_t is the probability under scenario t, t=1,...,T (recall that all scenarios are considered as equally probable);
 r_jt is the rate of return of security j, j=1,...,n, under scenario t, t=1,...,T;
 r_It is the rate of return of the benchmark index under scenario t, t=1,...,T.
